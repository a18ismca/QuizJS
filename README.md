# QuizJS

This is an application where the user is going to enter a quiz site if both the username and password are correct.
A user will have three attempts. For each incorrect inputs, the number of attempts is reduced with 1.
If either the inputted username or password is incorrect, a message will appear about the amount of attempts that the user have.
If the user has zero attempts, the user is going to wait a minute before receiving another three attempts. This process is repetitive.
The username and password must be inputted in order to count as an attempt.
Depending on what has been inputted in the username and password fields, various messages will appear if the username and password fields are empty.
